We have collected real student poses in the classroom under different environments, classrooms, subjects, numbers of people and camera angles to construct the POPO dataset, which contains very complex teaching and learning scenarios that allow for the detection and identification of students and their poses. POPO can provide powerful support for the study of students' states in the classroom.
